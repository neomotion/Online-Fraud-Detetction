# Online-Fraud-Detetction

This repository contains a machine learning project designed to detect online fraud using three different classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes Classifier. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook (OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb) that covers the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of the models.

# Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. The required dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
The main component of this repository is the Jupyter Notebook:

1.OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating three different models for online fraud detection.

2.Running the Notebook

3.Open the Notebook:

4.Open OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Follow the Instructions:
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the models, train them, and evaluate their performance.

# Data Preprocessing
The OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, which typically involve:

1.Loading the Data: Load the dataset containing transaction records and their corresponding labels indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.

2.Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

3.Feature Engineering: Create or transform features that will be used as inputs to the models.

4.Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

5.Model Training

The OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb notebook covers the following steps for model training:

1.Logistic Regression: Train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.

2.Decision Tree Classifier: Train a decision tree classifier on the preprocessed data.

3.Naive Bayes Classifier: Train a naive Bayes classifier on the preprocessed data.

4.Model Evaluation and Comparison

The OnlineFraudDetection.ipynb notebook includes comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the three models:

1.Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate the performance of each model.

2.Model Comparison: Compare the models based on the evaluation metrics and discuss their strengths and weaknesses in the context of online fraud detection.

3.Visualization: Visualize the performance of the models using plots and charts to provide a clear comparison.
